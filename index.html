				<h3>St. Andrews Cathedral:</h3>
				<p>Once the largest church in Scotland, St. Andrews Cathedral was built in 1158 and fell into disuse after the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century. Its ruins, including the massive east gable with its window outlines, give a sense of its former grandeur and importance in religious history.</p>

				<h3>Urquhart Castle :</h3>
				<p>Overlooking the waters of Loch Ness, Urquhart Castle plays a significant part in Scottish folklore and history. It was founded in the 13th century and saw great conflict during the Wars of Scottish Independence before largely being destroyed in 1692 to prevent its use by Jacobite forces.</p>

				<h3>Linlithgow Palace :</h3>
				<p>Birthplace of Mary, Queen of Scots, Linlithgow Palace was originally a royal manor established by King David I in the 12th century, later expanded into a grand palace by the Stewart kings. It was tragically gutted by fire in 1746 and now stands as an elegant, roofless ruin.</p>

				<h3>Dunstaffnage Castle :</h3>
				<p>This partially ruined castle near Oban dates back to the 13th century and is one of Scotland's oldest stone castles, strategically positioned to control the entrance to Loch Etive. It has a rich history as a stronghold of the MacDougalls and later the Campbells, and was captured briefly by Robert the Bruce during the Scottish Wars of Independence.</p>
